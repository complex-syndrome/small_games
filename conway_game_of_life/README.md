# Keys
- Mouse Drag / Click    -- Invert cell
- Space                 -- Pause
- s                     -- Pause and next step
- x                     -- Invert whole board
- c                     -- Change color (Fixed color change, unless r is pressed)
- r                     -- Randomize color change
- z                     -- Randomly invert blocks
- v                     -- Reset board
- \-                    -- Decrease step speed
- \+                    -- Increase step speed
